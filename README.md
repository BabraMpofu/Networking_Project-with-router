**Network Topology Project Documentation**

**Project Overview**
This comprehensive networking project demonstrates the implementation of five fundamental network topologies along withan integrated hybrid topology.
The project features dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 configuration, VLAN segmentation, and basic security measures.

**Five Topologies**

1.**Bus Topology**
- Layout :Linear network where all devices share a single communication line.
            

2. **Mesh Topology**
- Layout : Fully connected network where each device connects to every other device.

3. **Star Topology**
- Layout: All devices connect to a cental switch.

4. **Ring Topology**
- Layout : Each device connects to two others, forming a closed loop.

5. **Extended Star Topology**
- Layout : Hierarchical star topology with multiple levels of switches.


**Hybrid Topology**
-A hybrid topology combines all different network topologies together to create a more efficient and reliable network. 
It takes the best features from different designs and merges them into one superior network structure.
